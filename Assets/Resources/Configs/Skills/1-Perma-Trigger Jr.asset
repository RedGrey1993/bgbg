  backgroundStory: "This illicit modification kit is a limited-run product from the
    infamous \"Quickdraw Gang\" underground workshop.\r\nLegend has it that its core
    technology was salvaged from a decommissioned vending machine motor and a perpetually
    running hamster (now retired and living in Hawaii).\r\nOnce installed, the trigger
    becomes afflicted with the \"Eternal Youth Curse of the Perpetual Trigger\"\u2014it
    can never slow down again. Even if you intend to fire single shots, it will enthusiastically
    express itself in an unrelenting \"rat-a-tat-tat.\""
