  description: 'Damage up!

    "One more time... The last time!"'
  backgroundStory: It is composed of brain waves generated in the last second before
    countless 'GAME OVER' interfaces are forcibly closed. It is filled with the obsession
    of 'Play Again' and the rage at one's own incompetence. When you grasp it, you
    no longer fight for survival; you fight to vent your anger. Let this fury be
    your ammunition, and crush those damn monsters like broken controllers!
